# What I find interesting
I love both TTRPGS and software engineering, so this was an interesting read. A lot of the paralell it draws are pretty funny and managing a software team does feel as chaotic as a D&D compaigns at time.
I have ran and played a lot of D&D and this article offers a new perspective on both of the topics for me. Although I suppose A Dungeon Master doesn't neccesarily need the players to succeed in their endeavors while the scrum master absolutely wants to.
